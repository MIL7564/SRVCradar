-********** Winning Legion is announced WEEKLY and its members take a REST from donating to Homeless over the next week.

-********** The WORK (ENTERING a Receipt showing AMOUNT donated to Homeless individual) needed will ensure that Helpers not enter fake entries IF the aim is SACRED (helping the Homeless).
++ That is, it is not worthwhile making fake entries for a sacred project.
++ Note that the SACRED nature of help rendered helps ensure sanctity of the project AND motivates Helpers to do the WORK.
++ Note that the WORK required (entering a Recepit Amount) helps ensure sanctity of the project. A person will not forge a Receipt because it is not worth the expenditure of energy.
++ There is no Reward except a COLLECTIVE sense of helping those in need.
++ This is hard to believe because it is so SIMPLE.
++ Essentially you are creating an army of helpers for the homeless (Sentinels) divided into military like legions. There is honour among them.
++ This is the wisdom behind Suffering: it ensures sanctity of Work.

+ Gamification based on Quarterly Reports is better; as Annual Reports are not only seldom filed but also tend to converge on the end of the year. With Quarterly Reports, there will 
always be some company reporting - making for great gameplay.
