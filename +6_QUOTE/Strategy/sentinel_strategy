- Remove SUBJECT from WP Posts
- Time displayed ought to be based on the time provided by Mobilephone (Android Studio SMSReceiver.java)
- There should be 9 Users: Legion 1 ~ 9 mentioned as 'post by', instead of each post being by me (salmanshuaib).


- We will later have a barebones release for cellnet - for univeresal usage by anyone. Currently, i am focused on utilizing 
cellnet to help those in need and so the first few releases will be along those lines (functional, not barebones).
+ The functional versions will later be able to be plugged in like Modules (Applications) into cellnet.
-X["Belief in death is a self-fulfilling prophecy": we will remain a public repo; both sentinel and cellnet - considering also the 
competition b/w cellphone hardware developers, given particularly open-source OS like Android] At this point; where cellphone hardware development is centralized, it is not advisable for me to release "cellnet": the isoalted 
code for posting texts from mobilephone to website; as these centralized organizations will come under pressure to regulate a disruptive 
technology based on the excuse of potential privacy violations (by a few silly individuals).
+ The deployment of sentinel must now proceed at such a speed as to outflank efforts to restrict this ESA [Economic Solution Application].
++ I am making this repo private, for the time being. I will make it public when it is too late for those who wish to restrict technology that 
solves poverty. The project remains CC0.

- Massing,though possible; it will only generate traffic - not money. And while that may be apparent to the reader, for me - it is tough 
to focus on making money at the same time as pursuing an altruistic goal. However, I have observed that the most successful models are ones 
that are both altruistic AND have a revenue-source. For example, WordPress (open-source plus premium).
+ Perhaps fate is advising us that the Sponsors that we intend to rely on to sustain the gamification of the problem of poverty, are going 
to allude us - and therefore i present a parallel plan: a chain reaction of goodness, a veritable club:
++ Z: On our Flower Economics Inc. page on LinkedIn we COMMISSION regular individuals who are interested in exercising - to find individuals like themselves who also want to work out.
++ E: If Commissioner succeeds in enlisting a recruit, their membership fee is completely waived for as long as the recruit stays. If one is unable for some reason to bring in a member, they can pay a nominal membership fee. Thus you have the defintion of a Club. 
++ T: I will write an application "Rosemary" which displays the status of a Club Member (if they are Paying or Paired). 
++ A: The COMMISSIONERS are encouraged in the ATTITUDE and BODY necessary for the security field - by which we mean Military, Private Security, Peaceful Protests, Unarmed Provocations, Intelligence and generally as Good Samaritans intervening by asserting themselves where others can't. We plan to present material relating to this on our social media, as encouragement.

-********** As to the problem of massing, that is generating traffic for our website and application; I have once before been successful in 
accomplishing the same without any advertising dollar spend and that is to publish cause or activist related videos - particularly related 
to a particular champion - that highlight your objective as well.

- Incentive / Marketing [LOGINS]: As an added incentive for individuals to participate helping meet needs aside from the feel-good factor is RECOGNITION. If a ticket is closed appreciatively by the Sender (the person in need), then it will count as a Vote Of Confidence in the Responder. Individuals with higher Votes Of Confidence BLOCKS will receive Acknowledgment Wristbands (AWs) in their Legion's Color. Receiving AWs will require having a basic online account that registers your "Legion Number" and grants you a "sentinel PIN" - so that your AWs can be associated with your sentinel profile (PIN). Protection against Dictionary type attacks will be prevented by an Authenticator. In this way we will not need any private information from you in our database. If you lose your PIN, re-generate it.

- A TICKET can be included by System alongside Sender text on website. This constant TICKET can be used by Sender and Responder to converse with eachother over the website under the 'TOPIC' ("TICKET") dedicated to them.
+ This solves the problem of coordination between Sender and Responder.
+ This Ticketing system also preserves the privacy of the Sender and Responder as we only will need their CACs [City Areas Codes] for ascribing Penalty to the respective Legion.

- Area Codes for the SAME City can be clubbed under the same "City Names" so that if Sender is in another City; the Responder can 
check that City for NEEDS [obviously, a Responder in Beirut can not help a Sender in Toronto]. 

- sentinel alerts relies on Group Dynamics (Loyalty + Peer Pressure) to curtail the problem of Free Ridership.

- Those who wish to deploy garden-wealth must download a zip of the entire WordPress folder on our GITHUb.Com/salmanshuaib/sentinel because the Pluging....

- Flower Economics Inc. as a SOCIAL ENTERPRISE: 
+ We have to think of a way to associate sentinel with garden-wealth, charity with business, to work on these two plans simultaneously so that we do not end up getting undercut 
by profiteering companies.:
++ FE OPERATIONS: Instead of re-inventing the wheel and starting from scratch, why not choose the existing WordPress platform and design "sentinel" (the application for gamifying competition among Legion for 
Acts Of Kindness) as a WordPress Plugin.
++ FE LOGISTICS: In order to sustain the development of sentinel, we need a business to thrive on. And I have chosed "garden-wealth" as the name of the Plugin we will design for WordPress as a Logistics arm of Flower Economics Inc. 
+++ garden-wealth is a plugin that locates nearest registered Pedestrian to a Garden that a Customer orders from and gets that Garden's Produce to Customer via the Pedestrian.
COMMENT1: Rather than thinking of sentinel and garden-wealth as separate pursuits; lets say we make our first produce delivery from a garden to a customer - lets say we make it for free: this 
would be an Act Of Kindness (investment). It will receive a SWIFTER number of POINTS from our sentinel application as the delivery is indigenous to our Flower Economics Inc; we can enable direct communication between garden-wealth and sentinel via an API to tally the Act Of Kindness ~ an API that can also be used by other companies that want to participate in carrying out Acts Of Kindness in a gamified manner via the sentinel app.
COMMENT2: As the Pedestrian is not an employee of FE Inc. (stranger to FE), so we would need some form of receipt from the customer certifying that the produce was received. This receipt would 
be uploaded to through the API channel to sentinel and qualify as a set of points on the sentinel application.
COMMENT3: In this way we can have a standard way for any company to report its Acts Of Kindness, deriving (brand) value and recognition for them via a ticker highlight on FlowerEconomics.Com, via 
the standard API reporting process (i.e. a receipt from a customer is required and is uploaded for public view at FlowerEconomics.com [admin's email can be alerted to for by the community 
incase something obnoxious is uploaded online]).
NOTE1: We need garden-wealth to drive the Acts Of Kindess based sentinel application in the absence of initial interest in sentinel and also for its longterm viability.
NOTE2: We cannot make improvements to the sentinel application that can modify world economy and resource climate mitigation strategies among other challenges faced by humanity, without a business 
income sustaining development (hint hint).


- Freerider problem:
+ What if someone just keeps punching "yes" into our application to achieve victory for their Legion.
++ While this can happen, there is no reward from a Legion for its members to do so.
++ Even if someone does this, their Legion will achieve a day off from Acts Of Kindness (Work): as any philosopher would highlight it is more important to be productive than to not be productive. 
+++ For example, if my Legion gets a day off due to my constantly punching in "yes" without doing any Act Of Kindness (although it could be argued that achieving victory for your Legion is 
in itself an Act Of Kindness [Loyalty]); I will get the following day off from such acts (work) but my neighbour from another Legion will be hard at work, perhaps planting flowers. Therefore, 
while I lie like the rabbit lazy ~ my neighbour from another Legion will achieve Goodwill from others by his work done (planting a Flower). It is Goodwill that the Monetary economy is based on, I argue.
++++ Therefore, we can argue that Goodwill (productivity, the Monetary economy: when we know someone we do not charge them) is a check on Freeridership (loyalty, Amonetary economy: when we do not know someone we charge them).
+++++ Note, however, that the Monetary Economy is just an island compared to the ocean of Amonetary Economy ~ as most of the people in the Cosmos are ever unknown to us.

- Density of Acts Of Kindness:
+ What level of kind act of yours qualifies as an "Act Of Kindness" for our gameplay purposes in sentinel: the answer, as an economist (game theorist), is: any Act Of Kindness worth the time/effort 
of typing the sentence "yes" in our application.
++ So, this includes smiling at someone too. As it is said: even a smile is charity.
++ From this we understand that the most ENGAGED Legion will win the gameplay.
++ There is no INCENTIVE for players to be highly engaged WITHOUT actually committing actual Acts Of Kindness; for two reasons:
+++ The reward for victory is time off from giving; this is a communal incentive that an individual is only self-accountable for. 
+++ The game has a positive contribution to society which acts as a deterrent to claiming "Acts Of Kindness" without committing them.
++ By the time high engagement becomes competitive, we anticipate there would already be so much sponsorship of the gameplay that the game would be self-sustaining and Engagement in terms of 
saying "yes" without actually doing Acts Of Kindness would - as well - be worth it.

-********** Redux:
+ If we reduce the period of gameplay such that results are more frequent, I observed as an economist via mental modelling, that we can expand gameplay from just helping the 
homeless (whom are hard to locate on a daily basis compared to weekly gameplay) to covering the entire gamut of charity (donation: including to family members). As they say, Charity begins at home.

- Massing: 
+ As to why only help Homeless. I believe it will plug the HOLE in the economy. An aide to my aging grandmother told me when I was in Lahore (Pakistan) that he considers those rich in Lahore who own a house. The UNSDG1 (United Nations Sustainable Development Goal number one) is "No Poverty".
++ I have already elucidated in my earlier writings as to the efficacy of Goodwill and its invisible contribution to GDP. For example, your friend helps you move via his vehicle. You just saved 
$200 CAD or more if you are in Toronto.
+++ Therefore, Goodwill on a communal scale is enough to guide our Sentinal stratagem as it currently stands - without requiring receipts as proofs and the REWARD that winning Legion in the 
Community gets following WEEK off from donating.

-********** Winning Legion is announced WEEKLY and its members take a REST from donating to Homeless over the next week.

-********** The WORK (ENTERING a Receipt showing AMOUNT donated to Homeless individual) needed will ensure that Helpers not enter fake entries IF the aim is SACRED (helping the Homeless).
++ That is, it is not worthwhile making fake entries for a sacred project.
++ Note that the SACRED nature of help rendered helps ensure sanctity of the project AND motivates Helpers to do the WORK.
++ Note that the WORK required (entering a Recepit Amount) helps ensure sanctity of the project. A person will not forge a Receipt because it is not worth the expenditure of energy.
++ There is no Reward except a COLLECTIVE sense of helping those in need.
++ This is hard to believe because it is so SIMPLE.
++ Essentially you are creating an army of helpers for the homeless (Sentinels) divided into military like legions. There is honour among them.
++ This is the wisdom behind Suffering: it ensures sanctity of Work.

+ Gamification based on Quarterly Reports is better; as Annual Reports are not only seldom filed but also tend to converge on the end of the year. With Quarterly Reports, there will 
always be some company reporting - making for great gameplay.
