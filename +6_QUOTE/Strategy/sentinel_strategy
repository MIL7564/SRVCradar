- Density of Acts Of Kindness:
+ What level of kind act of yours qualifies as an "Act Of Kindness" for our gameplay purposes in sentinel: the answer, as an economist (game theorist), is: any Act Of Kindness worth the time/effort 
of typing the sentence "yes" in our application.
++ So, this includes smiling at someone too. As it is said: even a smile is charity.
++ From this we understand that the most ENGAGED Legion will win the gameplay.
++ There is no INCENTIVE for players to be highly engaged WITHOUT actually committing actual Acts Of Kindness; for two reasons:
+++ The reward for victory is time off from giving; this is a communal incentive that an individual is only self-accountable for. 
+++ The game has a positive contribution to society which acts as a deterrent to claiming "Acts Of Kindness" without committing them.
++ By the time high engagement becomes competitive, we anticipate there would already be so much sponsorship of the gameplay that the game would be self-sustaining and Engagement in terms of 
saying "yes" without actually doing Acts Of Kindness would - as well - be worth it.

-********** Redux:
+ If we reduce the period of gameplay such that results are more frequent, I observed as an economist via mental modelling, that we can expand gameplay from just helping the 
homeless (whom are hard to locate on a daily basis compared to weekly gameplay) to covering the entire gamut of charity (donation: including to family members). As they say, Charity begins at home.

- Massing: 
+ As to why only help Homeless. I believe it will plug the HOLE in the economy. An aide to my aging grandmother told me when I was in Lahore (Pakistan) that he considers those rich in Lahore who own a house. The UNSDG1 (United Nations Sustainable Development Goal number one) is "No Poverty".
++ I have already elucidated in my earlier writings as to the efficacy of Goodwill and its invisible contribution to GDP. For example, your friend helps you move via his vehicle. You just saved 
$200 CAD or more if you are in Toronto.
+++ Therefore, Goodwill on a communal scale is enough to guide our Sentinal stratagem as it currently stands - without requiring receipts as proofs and the REWARD that winning Legion in the 
Community gets following WEEK off from donating.

-********** Winning Legion is announced WEEKLY and its members take a REST from donating to Homeless over the next week.

-********** The WORK (ENTERING a Receipt showing AMOUNT donated to Homeless individual) needed will ensure that Helpers not enter fake entries IF the aim is SACRED (helping the Homeless).
++ That is, it is not worthwhile making fake entries for a sacred project.
++ Note that the SACRED nature of help rendered helps ensure sanctity of the project AND motivates Helpers to do the WORK.
++ Note that the WORK required (entering a Recepit Amount) helps ensure sanctity of the project. A person will not forge a Receipt because it is not worth the expenditure of energy.
++ There is no Reward except a COLLECTIVE sense of helping those in need.
++ This is hard to believe because it is so SIMPLE.
++ Essentially you are creating an army of helpers for the homeless (Sentinels) divided into military like legions. There is honour among them.
++ This is the wisdom behind Suffering: it ensures sanctity of Work.

+ Gamification based on Quarterly Reports is better; as Annual Reports are not only seldom filed but also tend to converge on the end of the year. With Quarterly Reports, there will 
always be some company reporting - making for great gameplay.
