# cellnet
+ Retrieves _texts_ that are sent to _your_ mobilephone containing the words **cellnet** and **opa** ["online posting allowed"]; posting them to your (_WordPress_) _website_. 
+ Borne of project [sentinel](https://github.com/salmanshuaib/cellnet/blob/main/%2B7_BREAKTHROUGH/applications/sentinel/README.md) - which turned out to just be an application of this meta concept. 🤔 sentinel is an alerts mechanism for those in need.
