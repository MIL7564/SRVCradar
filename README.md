## INTRODUCTION
_sentinel enables individuals to report their Acts Of Kindness to achieve points for their Legion. Each person is assigned to a Legion based on the city area code part of the telephphone number (screengrab shown is from an older model of sentinel)._

- [Introduction](): An Application that seeks to help those Homeless by gamifying competition among individuals donating to them. Size of donation does not matter. 
- [Gamification](): As there are 9 possible divisions of any organization based on the Assignment Management System hash function: that the sum of digits of any number resolves to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 OR 9: we issue a POINT to a Legion based on the number of Acts Of Kindness emanating from its ranks. Legion with the highest Points every week gets the following week off from donating.
- [Self-sustaining](): Competition between the 9 Legions ought attract sponsors.
- [Theory](): This hash function (the Assignment Management System) is auto-intelligent in that it can enable society to self-organize around a sacred goal by enabling rest period for the donors.
