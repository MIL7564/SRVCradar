## INTRODUCTION
_sentinel enables individuals to report their Acts Of Kindness to achieve points for their Legion. Each person is assigned to a Legion based on their city area code (screengrab shown is from an older model of sentinel)._

- [Introduction](): An Application that seeks to help those in any form of need by gamifying competition among individuals helping them.  
- [Gamification](): As there are 9 possible divisions of any organization based on the Assignment Management System hash function: that the sum of digits of any number resolves to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 OR 9: we issue a POINT to a Legion based on each Act Of Kindness. Legion with the highest Points every day gets the following day off from helping out.
- [Self-sustaining](): Competition between the 9 Legions ought attract sponsors.
- [Theory](): This hash function (the Assignment Management System) is auto-intelligent in that it can enable society to self-organize around a sacred goal by enabling rest period for the donors/helpers.
- [Intangibility](): As it is said, even a smile is charity. Therefore, as long as it is worth your time claiming a deed - every Act Of Kindness counts no matter how intangible. Engagement is just as important to gameplay as the game itself! When there was a gold rush in California, it was the suppliers of picks and shovels too that made excellent income.
