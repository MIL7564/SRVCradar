## INTRODUCTION
_sentinel enables individuals in need to issue alerts - particularly to their repsective Legions (each person is assigned to a Legion based on their telephone area code)._

- [Introduction](): An Application that enables alerts for individuals in need, gamifying the response.

- [Gamification](): As there are 9 possible divisions of any organization based on the Assignment Management System theorem: that the sum of digits of any number resolves to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 OR 9 ~ we issue a Penalty to a Legion based on the number of MESSAGES emanating from its ranks. This is purposed to minimize Free Ridership via group dynamics.

- [Self-sustaining](): Competition between the 9 Legions ought attract sponsors.

- [Strategic](): For the purposes of sentinel application, "need" is defined with broad strokes: it includes your need for a Canada Goose jacket or my need for Lettuce. It is hoped that sentinel 
can remodel the world economy and solve UNSDG #1: "No Poverty" in time for resourcing Climate Mitigation Strategies and treatments for the numerous diseases facing Humanity including such as AIDS, Cancer and Death.
