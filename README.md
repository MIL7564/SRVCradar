## INTRODUCTIONindividuals
_srvcRadar locates individuals in need - issuing alerts to their repsective Legions (each person is assigned to a Legion based on their first name initial in their own language of choice)._

- [Introduction](): A downloadable software that issues alerts for individuals in need, gamifying the response.
- [Gamification](): Competition will exist between the 9 possible Legions in rescuing the suffering.
- [Sport](): Each time a Citizen is helped by a Sentinel and receives a certificate from the Citizen that the Sentinel gets notarlized, counts as a point for the Legion.
-- The Sentinel can claim the document is notarized, it is upto some one else to challenge that. Unless challenged, the Sentnel's claim stands.
- [Self-sustaining](): Competition between the 9 Legions will attract sponsors.
- [Diversity](): Each Citizen can be helped based on their first name in their own language of preference; as A to I are 9 letters and you just need the first nine Letters of any language to incorporate that set (nation) into the game. For example, Rho is Letter 17 in the Greek alphabet - which means if your name began with Rho then you belong to Number 8 Legion [as 1+7=8] of the IMMERSIVEReality.
