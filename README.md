## INTRODUCTION
_sentinel locates individuals in need - issuing alerts to their repsective Legions (each person is assigned to a Legion based on their first name initial in their own language of choice)._

- [Introduction](): An App that issues alerts for individuals in need, gamifying the response.
- [Gamification](): As there are 9 possible divisions of any organization based on the Assignment Management System theorem that the sum of digits of any number resolves to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 OR 9 ~ this combined with the Engineering principle of picking the simplest course when confronted with multiple optios: we score a point for a Legion basaed on the number of MESSAGES tabulated that begin with a specific initial or its recurrence.
- [Self-sustaining](): Competition between the 9 Legions will attract sponsors.
- [Diversity](): Each Citizen can be helped based on their first name in their own language of preference; as A to I are 9 letters and you just need the first nine Letters of any language to incorporate that set (nation) into the game. For example, Rho is Letter 17 in the Greek alphabet - which means if your name began with Rho then you belong to Number 8 Legion [as 1+7=8] of the IMMERSIVEReality.
