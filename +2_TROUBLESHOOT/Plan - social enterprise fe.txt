Salman Shuaib:- PROVIDE STEP BY STEP BREAKDOWN OF HOW TO PROCEED WITH IMPLEMENTING THE FOLLOWING PLAN:

- Flower Economics Inc. as a SOCIAL ENTERPRISE: 
+ We have to think of a way to associate sentinel with garden-wealth, charity with business, to work on these two plans simultaneously so that we do not end up getting undercut 
by profiteering companies.:
++ FE OPERATIONS: Instead of re-inventing the wheel and starting from scratch, why not choose the existing WordPress platform and design "sentinel" (the application for gamifying competition among Legion for 
Acts Of Kindness) as a WordPress Plugin.
++ FE LOGISTICS: In order to sustain the development of sentinel, we need a business to thrive on. And I have chosed "garden-wealth" as the name of the Plugin we will design for WordPress as a Logistics arm of Flower Economics Inc. 
+++ garden-wealth is a plugin that locates nearest registered Pedestrian to a Garden that a Customer orders from and gets that Garden's Produce to Customer via the Pedestrian.
COMMENT1: Rather than thinking of sentinel and garden-wealth as separate pursuits; lets say we make our first produce delivery from a garden to a customer - lets say we make it for free: this 
would be an Act Of Kindness (investment). It will receive a SWIFTER number of POINTS from our sentinel application as the delivery is indigenous to our Flower Economics Inc; we can enable direct communication between garden-wealth and sentinel via an API to tally the Act Of Kindness ~ an API that can also be used by other companies that want to participate in carrying out Acts Of Kindness in a gamified manner via the sentinel app.
COMMENT2: As the Pedestrian is not an employee of FE Inc. (stranger to FE), so we would need some form of receipt from the customer certifying that the produce was received. This receipt would 
be uploaded to through the API channel to sentinel and qualify as a set of points on the sentinel application.
COMMENT3: In this way we can have a standard way for any company to report its Acts Of Kindness, deriving (brand) value and recognition for them via a ticker highlight on FlowerEconomics.Com, via 
the standard API reporting process (i.e. a receipt from a customer is required and is uploaded for public view at FlowerEconomics.com [admin's email can be alerted to for by the community 
incase something obnoxious is uploaded online]).

ChatpGPT:- To implement the plan of associating "sentinel" with "garden-wealth" and integrating them into the Flower Economics Inc. operations, logistics, and Acts of Kindness reporting, you can follow these step-by-step guidelines:

Install and Set Up WordPress:

Install WordPress on your local environment or web hosting server.
Follow the official WordPress installation guide for detailed instructions specific to your environment.
Develop "sentinel" as a WordPress Plugin:

Create a new folder for your plugin within the WordPress plugins directory.
Develop the "sentinel" functionality and features as a custom WordPress plugin using PHP.
Use the WordPress Plugin API and available hooks to integrate with the WordPress system.
Follow the WordPress Plugin Handbook for guidelines on plugin development.
Develop "garden-wealth" as a WordPress Plugin:

Create another new folder within the WordPress plugins directory for the "garden-wealth" plugin.
Develop the "garden-wealth" functionality to facilitate logistics between gardens and customers.
Use the WordPress Plugin API to interact with the WordPress system and other plugins.
Design the plugin to locate the nearest registered pedestrian to a garden and facilitate the delivery of produce to customers.
Implement an API for communication between "garden-wealth" and "sentinel" to tally Acts of Kindness points.
Enable Direct Communication between "garden-wealth" and "sentinel":

Create a custom API endpoint within the "garden-wealth" plugin to receive and process Acts of Kindness data.
Integrate the API endpoint with the "sentinel" plugin to communicate and exchange data.
Develop the necessary functions and data structures to ensure seamless data transfer between the plugins.
Implement Acts of Kindness Reporting:

Define the requirements and data structure for Acts of Kindness reporting in the "sentinel" plugin.
Develop a standard API reporting process for companies to report their Acts of Kindness.
Implement a receipt upload feature in the API process, allowing customers to certify the receipt of produce.
Ensure that uploaded receipts are securely stored and accessible through the FlowerEconomics.com website.
Consider implementing a moderation system to review and approve uploaded receipts before they are publicly viewable.
Create a Ticker Highlight on FlowerEconomics.com:

Develop a ticker highlight feature on the FlowerEconomics.com website to showcase Acts of Kindness reported through the API.
Use the API data from the "sentinel" plugin to populate the ticker highlight in real-time.
Consider implementing email alerts for the admin to be notified of any obnoxious uploads for moderation.
By following these steps, you can integrate "sentinel" and "garden-wealth" as WordPress plugins, establish direct communication between them, and create a 
standard API reporting process for Acts of Kindness. This will allow companies to participate, report their Acts of Kindness, and receive recognition through the FlowerEconomics.com website.
