//pseudocode: 
/* If Text arrives saying "#housing"
+ has text arrived in 
++ my Mobilephone
++ Or the Googlesheet
+ Where should we intercept it?
+ What is our purpose:
++ Our purpose is putting 9 Commands in competition
+++ Commands are determined based on initial of first name of Alerter_
+ The intercept would have to occur between Mobilephone and IFTTT Service Android SMS; at IFTTT website.
++ This is the INTERCEPT pseudocode:
+++ Assign name of Alerter to one of the 9 STANDARDIZING commands: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 based on first inititial of first name_
+++ For the foresaid purpose, the INTERCEPTING JavaScript must validate the FORM of the Alerter's entry (sent Text): 
++++ FORMAT is: mary morrison #housing spotted an individual near Bay/Bloor intersection
++++ FORMAT is: firstname lastname #need description
++++ If received Text does not match this FOMRAT; then ideally a response Text is sent to Alerter (or they may learn on own) that their Text lacks the standard format_
