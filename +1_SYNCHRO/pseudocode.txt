1. I NEED AN INPUT FIELD ON MY WordPress HOME PAGE WITH A SUBMIT BUTTON IN A PHP PLUGIN CALLED sentinel. THE INPUT FIELD ASKS FOR THE "City Area Code" PART OF AN UNAUTHENTICATED WORDPRESS 
USER'S TELEPHONE NUMBER. E.G. MY City Area Code IS 437 [KINDLY SHOW THIS AS A FADED EXAMPLE IN THE INPUT FIELD].
2. NEXT A STATEMENT IS WRITTEN BELOW THE ABOVE INPUT FIELD: "IF YOU CARRIED OUT AN ACT OF KINDNESS, SELECT FROM AMONG THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS: 
A: "Take my word for it [1 Point]" FOLLOWED BY ["Submit" BUTTON (signifies Option A chosen by User)].
B: "Let me upload proof [20 Points]" FOLLOWED BY ["Upload" BUTTON (signifies Option B chosen by User)].
NOTE1: IN THE FUTURE THERE WILL BE OTHER TIERS OF POINTS BASED ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF STRESS (TIME) THAT GOES INTO UPLOADNG THAT PROOF (INCLUDING WORKING TOWARDS IT; SUCH AS TOWARDS A 
UNIVERSITY DEGREE [Appraisal]). 
3. The garden-wealth PLUGIN PHOTOGALLERY CONCURRENTLY DISPLAYS PAST AND NEW PROOFS UPLOADED. ITS CODE IS AS FOLLOWS BUT THE "Upload" BUTTON LOCATION WILL NEED TO BE ADJUSTED TO ABOVE THE PHOTO
GALLERY AS WE DID NOT ACCOUNT FOR ABOVE OPTION A ("Take my word for it") IN THE FOLLOWING garden-wealth CODE:

4. A DATABASE TABLE "league" IS cREATED WITH TWO COLUMNS: "Legion Number" AND "Score". THIS TABLE league IS DISPLAYED ON THE HOMEPAGE BELOW STEP 3's PHOTO GALLERY garde-wealth.
5. NOW I WANT TO CONVERT THE JavaScript FUNCTION resolute(phNum) PREVIOUSLY POSTED IN OUR CHAT ABOVE INTO PHP CODE FOR MY WordPress PLUGIN sentinel.
6. THEN THE LAST DIGIT RETURNED BY THE PHP FUNCTION [PREVIOUSLY JS FUNCTION ] (RESULTANT DIGIT WILL BE EITHER 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 OR 9) IS MATCHED AGAINST THE "Legion Number" AND THE MATCHING LEGION 
NUMBER'S SCORE IS ITERATED WITH 1 POINT OR 20 POINTS DEPENDING ON WHETHER OPTION A or OPTION B WAS CHOSEN. THE STARTING SCORE OF EACH LEGION IS ZERO.
7. ANOTHER DATABASE TABLE "result" IS CREATED THAT TAKES A SNAPSHOT OF THE HIGHEST SCORING LEGION(S) AT 23:59:59 HOURS DAILY (New York City time) AND STORES THESE UNDER COLUMNS: 
"Winning Legions(s)", "Date", "Points Achieved".
8. A SEPARATE PLUGIN CALLED sentinel-recognition DISPLAYS A COLORED "Hall Of Fame" MATRIX SHOWING THE WINNER EACH DAY. TODAY, "SUNDAY 18 JUN 2023AD", ALL LEGIONS ARE LISTED AS WINNERS BUT WITH 
"Points Achieved" OF 0.
9. REGISTERED USERS WITH "Editor" WORDPRESS PRIVILEGE CAN DELETE THE A OR B RESPONSE OF ANY USER GOING BACK UPTO 7 WEEKS AND THE "Hall Of Fame" WOULD BE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY 
RETROACTIVELY VIA PAGINATION.  


-2- Write Code in Dart for Flutter with the following pseudocode (please ensure attractive graphics):
+ Ask the user to enter his/her three-character City Area Code [CAC] part of his/her telephone number.
+ Advise the user via Dart version of [resolute(phNum)] function in following SCRIPT written in JavaScript of their Legion Number based on their CAC so they can root for their team (Legion).
+ Pull information from EDGAR database (JSON formatted) with the following facts for every company:
++1 Company Name
++2 (City) Area Code of company's primary telephone number [three characters conventionally].
++3 Cost Of Goods Sold [COGS].
+ Store the above three facts in a SQLite database meant for Dart (Flutter).
+ Retrieve each company's city area code (CAC) in turn and convert it into one digit in Dart language using the [resolute(phNum)] function in following SCRIPT written in JavaScript [Assignment Management System hash function].
++ Store the Resolute (the singularized representation of CAC) for each company as a fourth column for each entry in the SQLite database. The Resolute for a Company is its Legion Number.
++ Sum the COGS for all companies in each Legion. Display the RANKINGS for each Legion in a table: The leading Legions are the ones that have spent the most into the economy (as Cost Of Goods Sold).

+++ SCRIPT:
/*dart
This code snippet provides a basic implementation that you can further enhance and adapt to your specific requirements. It includes functions for prompting the user for input, retrieving 
company data from the EDGAR database, and storing and querying the data in a SQLite database. The Resolute value is calculated using the provided `resolute` function, and the rankings 
based on COGS are displayed. 

Remember to replace the placeholder functions (`promptForCAC` and `retrieveCompanyDataFromEDGAR`) with your actual implementation for user input and 
data retrieval.

Note: This code assumes you have the necessary dependencies (`sqflite` and `path`) added to your Flutter project. You can add them to your `pubspec.yaml` file and 
run `flutter pub get` to download the dependencies.

January 1, 2023AD for each company in EDGAR database.

To ensure that SEC.gov remains available to all users, we reserve the right to block IP addresses that submit excessive requests.
"data.sec.gov" was created to host RESTful data Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) delivering JSON-formatted data to external customers and to web pages on SEC.gov. These APIs do not require any authentication or API keys to access.

Currently included in the APIs are the submissions history by filer and the XBRL data from financial statements (forms 10-Q, 10-K,8-K, 20-F, 40-F, 6-K, and their variants).

The JSON structures are updated throughout the day, in real time, as submissions are disseminated.

In addition, a bulk ZIP file is available to download all the JSON structures for an API. This ZIP file is updated and republished nightly at approximately 3:00 a.m. ET.

data.sec.gov/submissions/
Each entity’s current filing history is available at the following URL:

https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK##########.json
Where the ########## is the entity’s 10-digit Central Index Key (CIK), including leading zeros.

This JSON data structure contains metadata such as current name, former name, and stock exchanges and ticker symbols of publicly-traded companies. The object’s property path contains at least one year’s of filing or to 1,000 (whichever is more) of the most recent filings in a compact columnar data array. If the entity has additional filings, files will contain an array of additional JSON files and the date range for the filings each one contains.

XBRL data APIs
Extensible Business Markup Language (XBRL) is an XML-based format for reporting financial statements used by the SEC and financial regulatory agencies across the world. XBRL, in a separate XML file or more recently embedded in quarterly and annual HTML reports as inline XBRL, was first required by the SEC in 2009. XBRL facts must be associated for a standard US-GAAP or IFRS taxonomy. Companies can also extend standard taxonomies with their own custom taxonomies.

The following XBRL APIs aggregate facts from across submissions that

Use a non-custom taxonomy (e.g. us-gaap, ifrs-full, dei, or srt)
Apply to the entire filing entity
This ensures that facts have a consistent context and meaning across companies and between filings and are comparable between companies and across time.

data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/
The company-concept API returns all the XBRL disclosures from a single company (CIK) and concept (a taxonomy and tag) into a single JSON file, with a separate array of facts for each units on measure that the company has chosen to disclose (e.g. net profits reported in U.S. dollars and in Canadian dollars).

https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/CIK##########/us-gaap/AccountsPayableCurrent.json
data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyfacts/
This API returns all the company concepts data for a company into a single API call:

https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyfacts/CIK##########.json
data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/frames/
The xbrl/frames API aggregates one fact for each reporting entity that is last filed that most closely fits the calendrical period requested. This API supports for annual, quarterly and instantaneous data:

https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/frames/us-gaap/AccountsPayableCurrent/USD/CY2019Q1I.json
Where the units of measure specified in the XBRL contains a numerator and a denominator, these are separated by “-per-” such as “USD-per-shares”. Note that the default unit in XBRL is “pure”.

The period format is CY#### for annual data (duration 365 days +/- 30 days), CY####Q# for quarterly data (duration 91 days +/- 30 days), and CY####Q#I for instantaneous data. Because company financial calendars can start and end on any month or day and even change in length from quarter to quarter to according to the day of the week, the frame data is assembled by the dates that best align with a calendar quarter or year. Data users should be mindful different reporting start and end dates for facts contained in a frame.

CORS
data.sec.gov does not support Cross Origin Resource Scripting (CORS). Automated access must comply with SEC.gov’s Privacy and Security Policy, as described in the   Developer FAQ.

Bulk data
The most efficient means to fetch large amounts of API data is the bulk archive ZIP files, which are recompiled nightly.

The companyfacts.zip file contains all the data from the XBRL Frame API and the XBRL Company Facts API
           https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/daily-index/xbrl/companyfacts.zip

The submission.zip file contains the public EDGAR filing history for all filers from the Submissions API
           https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/daily-index/bulkdata/submissions.zip 

Update schedule
The APIs are updated in real-time as filings are disseminated. The submissions API is updated with a typical processing delay of less than a second; the xbrl APIs are updated with a typical processing delay of under a minute. However these processing delays may be longer during peak filing times.

-1- I am simplifying the following gameplay (script: sentinelCOGS.dart); please make the following edits to sentinelCOGS.dart to produce a new script sentinel.dart:
+ Keep the part in  sentinelCOGS.dart where user enters his CAC (City Area Code).
+ Ask the user to enter amount donated to Homeless (ask this alongside when we ask for CAC).
+ Keep the part in  sentinelCOGS.dart where the CAC is condensed into a single digit which we call the Legion Number.
+ Erase the rest of the code in sentinelCOGS.dart.
+ For each entry of amount donated ("Act Of Kindness"), a point is earned by the user's respective Legion.
+ A scoreboard displays the current scores of each Legion.
+ Winning Legion every WEEK is highlighted in PINK and advised next week off from donating to those Homeless.
